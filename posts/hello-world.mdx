Hello there 👋

## About me

Before introduce about this blog, I think I should introduce myself first.
Currently, I still studying in university but I have been working in company
for more than two years. After worked as Front-end Engineer, Back-end
Engineer, Full-stack Engineer and Blockchain Engineer, I realized that I love
making UI which is communicate directly to users.

## About this blog

This blog is the space that I'll use to share what I learnt, working
experiences, and sometimes it would be my thoughts about something.

I may starts with some posts about Web 3.0 because most of my friends are
confusing and understanding it incorrectly.

Thank you for reading, hope you enjoy my posts in the future 🙏
